            From the first day until the second test:- I'll study harder and will become a topper and forget all my hardships and will begin to study from scratch and learn everything.
           One guy comes and tells you that you have spent 15 years studying. Why don't you enjoy at least first year of engineering as it's nothing but the basic thing which you already have read in your intermediate?
           You feel the same and enjoy like anything.
